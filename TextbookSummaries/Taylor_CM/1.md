## 1.1: Classical Mechanics

* Mechanics is the study of motion.
* Classical mechanics encompasses three equivalent formulations of mechanics: Newtonian, Hamiltonian, and Lagrangian.  The Newtonian formulation was the first to be developed chronologically, and is usually the one taught in freshman level mechanics classes.  Hamiltonian and Lagrangian were later formulations but they offer simpler solutions to many complicated problems.
* The field of classical mechanics has become popular in recent years with the advent of chaos theory.

## 1.2: Space and Time

* Newton's three laws are formulated in terms of four crucial underlying concepts: space, time, mass, and force

### Space

* Every point P in three-dimensional space can be described with a position vector **r** given some origin O.  The position vector specifies the distance and direction P is from O.  *Every vector can be split into a direction (specified by the unit vector) and a distance (specified by the magnitude).*

* One of the most common ways to represent a three-dimension vector in space:

$$ \textbf{r} = x\hat{x} + y\hat{y} + z\hat{z}$$

* $$\hat{x}$$, $$\hat{y}$$, and $$\hat{z}$$ are unit vectors that point along the x, y, and z axes respectively.
* Common choices for unit vectors also include **i**, **j**, and **k**.
* Writing position as a vector:

$$\textbf{r} = (x, y, z)$$

* For most vectors, components will be indicated using subscript x, y, and z: r$$_x, r$$_y$$, r$$_z$$ for example.
* When more than three components are present it can be convenient to to write vectors as:

r$$_1$$ = x; r$$_2$$ = y; r$$_3$$ = z

**e$$_1$$** = $$\textbf{\hat{x}}$$; **e$$_2$$** = $$\textbf{\hat{y}}$$; **e$$_3$$** = $$\textbf{\hat{z}}$$

* This notation is convenient because it leads to an easy notation for vectors of more than three components;

$$\textbf{r} = r_1\textbf{e_1} + r_2\textbf{e_2} + r_3\textbf{e_3} = \sum_{i=1}^3 r_i\textbf{e_i}$$

### Vector Operations

* Vector addition

$$\textbf{r} + \textbf{s} = (r_1 + s_1, r_2 + s_2, r_3 + s_3)$$

* When two forces **F$$_a$$** and **F$$_b$$** act on an object, the effect is the same as a single force, the resultant force, which is the vector sum of **F$$_a$$** and **F$$_b$$**

$$\textbf{F} = \textbf{F_a} + \textbf{F_b}$$

* Multiplying a vector by a scalar

$$c\textbf{r} = (cr_1, cr_2, cr_3)$$

* Scalar or Dot Product 

$$ \textbf{r} \dot \textbf{s} = rscos(\theta) = r_1s_1 + r_2s_2 + r_3s_3 = \sum_{i=1}^3 r_is_i$$

* The magnitude (length) of a vector **r**, denotes as |**r**|:

$$|\text{r}| = \sqrt{r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2} = \sqrt{r \dot r}$$
