## 1.1: Classical Mechanics

* Mechanics is the study of motion.
* Classical mechanics encompasses three equivalent formulations of mechanics: Newtonian, Hamiltonian, and Lagrangian.  The Newtonian formulation was the first to be developed chronologically, and is usually the one taught in freshman level mechanics classes.  Hamiltonian and Lagrangian were later formulations but they offer simpler solutions to many complicated problems.
* The field of classical mechanics has become popular in recent years with the advent of chaos theory.

## 1.2: Space and Time

* Newton's three laws are formulated in terms of four crucial underlying concepts: space, time, mass, and force

### Space

* Every point P in three-dimensional space can be described with a position vector **r** given some origin O.  The position vector specifies the distance and direction P is from O.  *Every vector can be split into a direction (specified by the unit vector) and a distance (specified by the magnitude).*

* One of the most common ways to represent a three-dimension vector in space:
