## 1.1: Classical Mechanics

* Mechanics is the study of motion.
* Classical mechanics encompasses three equivalent formulations of mechanics: Newtonian, Hamiltonian, and Langrangian.  The Newtonian formulation was the first to be developed chronologically, and is usually the one taught in freshman level mechanics classes.  Hamiltonian and Langrangian were later formulations but they offer simplier solutions to many complicated problems.
* The field of classical mechanics has become popular in recent years with the advent of chaos theory.
