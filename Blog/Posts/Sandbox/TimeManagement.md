# My Daily Time Mangement System

## My Method Explained
My method for time management is a combination of a Bullet Journal and the Pomodoro Technique.


## My Method In Practice
Let's say that I have decided that I have 14 hours that I can devote to research/classes/personal project for today.  First I write down all of the events I have to do in the day and denote them with a square (to signify on the day's list that they are events).

Next to each event I draw one circle per 30 minutes that the event is expected to take.  So a meeting with my advisor would get 2 circles as it is expected to last one hour and a 1.5 hour class would get three circles.

After taking into account my events I have 11.5 hours I can devote to other tasks.  I start by writing down my 6 most important tasks (i.e. the things I have to get done today).  The number of tasks comes from [The Ivy Lee Method]().  Six tasks is the number of tasks I have found I can reasonable accomplish in a day but you can increase or decrease this number to fit your needss.  The order I write the tasks down in is not important but you could also write them down in the order you plan on doing them or in decreasing importance.

Next I start distributing circles to each tasks based either on how long it will take or how long I can spend on that task today.  Typically I will not add enough circles to take up all of my time because other things may come up throughout the day that demand my attention.  So if I know I have about 11.5 hours to work on my tasks, I can distribute 20 circles (25 minutes of work and a 5 minute break so 30 minutes in total).

After I complete one Pomodoro cycle for a task I put an X through one of the circles.  After I complete all of the Pomodoro cycles for one task I cross the task off.  I like to highlight a task to cross it off because the highlighted lines are another visual indication of how much work I have gotten done.
