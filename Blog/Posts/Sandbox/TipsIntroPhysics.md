## Tips for Introductory Physics Classes

### "Practice, practice, practice. If you do not practice you will not succeed."

This is a quote from my high school chemistry/physics teacher and it is something that has stuck with me throughout all these years.  The only good way to get good at physics, or chemistry or math, is to practice.  Do as many problems as possible.  Reading the notes and studying definitions and equations will only get you so far.  

### SI In, SI Out

Always do you problems in SI units (meters, kilograms, seconds, etc.).  If you plug SI units into all of the standard physics equations, your answer will be in SI units.  For example, given the equation F=ma, if m is in kg and a is in m/s$$^2$$, then F will be in N, the SI unit for force.

### Quantities with different units can not be set equal to each other

You can not set values with different units equal to each other.  This is a big mistake that a lot of people in introductory physics classes make.  

### You can usually figure out what to do purely through looking at the units

### Check to see if your answer makes sense.

After you solve a problem and get to the final, numerical answer, check to see i the answer makes sense.  If you are solving for the mass of a ball but you get an answer on the order of 100kg, then you probably did something wrong in your calculations.  Or if you are solving for time and get a negative number then thay probably is not correct.

### Solve equations in variables, only plug in numbers at the very end

A lot of mistakes happen when working with numbers, either writing them down wrong or plugging them into a calculator wrong.  If you solve your problme using only variables, and manupulate the equations in variable form, not only will you reduce your risk of error, you may end up making the problem simpler.  For example, see my notes on [simple projectile motion](https://tensorsinrain.github.io/Tutorials/Physics/SimpleProjectileMotion.html).
