# Julie's Rules for Introductory Physics Classes

## The Problem: A Box Slides Down A Ramp

Let's consider the below problem, which is a common type of problem found in all introductory physics classes.

## How to Solve a Problem in Introductory Physics Classes
### 1. Draw a picture

If a picture is not provided with the problem, draw one.  Even a rough sketch is better than no picture at all.

### 2. Choose a reference frame

This sounds like a scary step but for introductory physics classes all it means is you have to set where t=0 occurs, where the spatial origin (i.e. **r** = (0, 0, 0)) is, and how the coordinate axes should be rotated.

### 3. Write down any knowns, separated by the direction in which they are relevant
### 4. Write down any unknowns you need to solve for, separated by the direction in which they are relevant
### 5. Using the knowns and unknows as a guide, write down an equations that may be helpful to solve the problem

### "Practice, practice, practice. If you do not practice you will not succeed."

This is a quote from my high school chemistry/physics teacher and it is something that has stuck with me throughout all these years.  The only good way to get good at physics, or chemistry or math, is to practice.  Do as many problems as possible.  Reading the notes and studying definitions and equations will only get you so far.  

### SI In, SI Out

Always do you problems in SI units (meters, kilograms, seconds, etc.).  If you plug SI units into all of the standard physics equations, your answer will be in SI units.  For example, given the equation F=ma, if m is in kg and a is in m/s$$^2$$, then F will be in N, the SI unit for force.

### Quantities with different units can not be set equal to each other

### You can usually figure out what to do purely through looking at the units

### Check to see if your answer makes sense.

After you solve a problem and get to the final, numerical answer.  If you are solving for the mass of a ball but you get an answer on the order of 100kg, then you probably did something wrong in your calculations.

### Solve equations in variables, only plug in numbers at the very end

A lot of mistakes happen when working with numbers, either writing them down wrong or plugging them into a calculator wrong.  If you solve your problme using only variables, and manupulate the equations in variable form, not only will you reduce your risk of error, you may end up making the problem simpler.  For example, see my notes on [simple projectile motion](https://tensorsinrain.github.io/Tutorials/Physics/SimpleProjectileMotion.html).
