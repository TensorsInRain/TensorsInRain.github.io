# Julie's Rules for Introductory Physics Classes

1. Practice, practice, practice. If you do not practice you will not succeed
2. Quantities with different units can not be set equal to each other
3. You can usually figure out what to do purely through looking at the units
4. Check to see if your answer makes sense
5. Solve equations in variables, only plug in numbers at the very end
