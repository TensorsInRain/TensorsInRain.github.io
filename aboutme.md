I am a graduate student at Michigan State University studying many-body nuclear physics and machine learning.  When researching a new topic in these subjects it is typically difficult to find one source with a holostic explanation.  My hope is that this site will be a helpful tool for other people research topics in machine learning and many-body theory.
