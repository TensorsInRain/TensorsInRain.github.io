Go through this tutorial interactively on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LwWNOu_Aq0yXXKBxjIq4m0WZeNwn6tj7).  Once you follow the link click "Open in Playground" (this does not save your work) or download as an ".ipynb" file and upload it to your own Google Drive if you want to keep your progress.


Python can also be used to do math.  For example, I can type `2+2` in a print statement and it will print the result (`4`).

``` python
print(2 + 2)
```

Output:
```
4
```

Python can also be used for substraction, multiplication, and division.

``` python
print(3 - 2)

print(4*5)

print(21/3)
```

Output:
```
1
20
7.0
```

Variables can be used to hold the result of a mathematical expression (See the tutorial on [variables](https://jhartley1121.github.io/Tutorials/Python/VariablesAndPrint.html).  For example:

``` python
a = 2 + 2

print(a)
```

Output:

```
4
```
