# Simple Projectile Motion With Kinematics

A common problem in an introductory mechanics class involves simple projectile motion.  This type of problem is usually introduced fairly early in the course.  Simple projectile motion problems deal with the motion of an object given an initial speed and launch angle.  This tutorial will go over main calculations from simple projectile motion problems using kinematic equations, as well as a couple of example problems.

## Problem Set-up

An object with some mass, m, is launched with some initial speed, v_i, and at some angle, \theta.

## Main Assumptions

* Motion only takes place in two dimensions: x (horizontal) and y (vertical).
* There is not air resistance or any other forces acting on the object besides gravity.
* The object is near Earth's surface so gravitation accleration can be represented as (0, -9.81) m/s^2
* The object is a point mass particle, meaning that it has mass but no size.
* All measurements and answers will be in SI units.
* Unless told otherwise, the object's initial position is (0, 0)m.
* Unless told otherwise, the object's final y position is 0m.

## Initial Velocity

### Short Answer

In vector form: **v_i** = (v_i*cos(\theta), v_i*sin(\theta)) (remember that bold quantities are vectors and non-bold quantities are scalars)

In component form: v_i,x = v_i*cos(\theta); v_i,y = v_i*sin(\theta)

$$\forall x \in R$$
